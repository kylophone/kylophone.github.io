# Kyle Swanson

I write backend code and maintain broadcast systems for [Minnesota Public Radio](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Minnesota+Public+Radio/@44.9488841,-93.095812,3a,75y,91.17h,109.08t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1szhKjHEHnjmevRnRtG4MBKw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m2!3m1!1s0x87f7d5528ec8a0b9:0x27afa5dc5d22eecf!6m1!1e1). Before that, I was a music & electrical engineering student at the University of Minnesota. My background is in digital audio & signal processing. I write lots of C, Python, Ruby, and lots of HTML5/JS/CSS too. My day job is Ruby on Rails. Before I wrote code, I was a recording engineer. Please see this [ASCII flowchart](https://github.com/kylophone/lifeflow/blob/master/README.md).
